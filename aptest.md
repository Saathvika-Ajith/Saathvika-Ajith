## Finals 1 Test Corrections: 46/50
- Question | Correction
- Q24 | Answer A. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.
- Q29 | Answer C. Because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended.
- Q37 | Answer D. x = 3, y = 2, z = 1.
- Q45 | Answer C. The cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.
