## Finals 1 Test Corrections: 46/50
- Question | Correction
- Q24 | Answer A. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.
- Q29 | Answer C. Because the variable sum is initialized to store the value of the first element of numList, and because the iteration block is a FOR EACH loop, the value of the first element is added to sum twice. Since the first element of the list is 0, adding this number to the sum does not affect the sum. A non-zero first element would give an incorrect result. In general, a single test case is not sufficient to confirm that a program works as intended.
- Q37 | Answer D. x = 3, y = 2, z = 1.
- Q45 | Answer C. The cost of a given product is not tracked by the described search engine.

## Finals 2 Test Corrections: 45/50
- Question | Correction
- Q14 | Answer A. The two line graphs are roughly the same shape. Each value on the right line graph is about 10 times the corresponding value on the left line graph. Therefore, the average amount of data stored per user is about 10 GB.
- Q22 | Answer B. IPv6 allows for a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 does, which allows more devices to be connected.
- Q27 | Answer D. Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.
- Q39 | Answer B and C. Different users may abbreviate city names differently. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed. Misspelled city names will not be an exact match to information stored by the Web site. This may require the student to clean the data to make it uniform before it can be processed.
- Q42 | Answer B and C. Cloud computing fosters new ways to communicate and collaborate, allowing users to share files and tools easily. Cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users’ private data.

## Finals 3 Test Corrections: 44/50
- Question | Correction
- Q12 | Answer A. Creative Commons licensing allows copyright owners to specify the ways in which their works can be used or distributed. This allows individuals to access or modify these works without the risk of violating copyright laws.
- Q18 | Answer C. The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values.
- Q34 | Answer B. As this algorithm has a factorial efficiency, it does not run in a reasonable amount of time. A heuristic approach can be used to find an approximate solution than can run in a reasonable amount of time.
- Q36 | Answer B & D. When numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect > 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore "check minus" is displayed instead of the intended "check plus". When numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect > 7 evaluates to false. Therefore "check" is displayed instead of the intended "check minus".
- Q41 | Answer D. In public cryptography, a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key and decrypted with the recipient’s private key.
- Q50 | Answer A. The variable first is initially assigned the value 100 and the variable second is initially assigned the value 200. Next, temp is assigned the value of first, which is 100. Next, second is assigned the value of temp, which is 100. Last, first is assigned the value of second, which is 100. After execution, both first and second have the value 100.

## Finals 5 Test Corrections: 44/50
- Question | Correction
- Q15 | Answer C. The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the
corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
- Q17 | Answer D. Version I calls the GetPrediction procedure once for each element of idList, or four times total. Since each call requires 1 minute of execution time, version I requires approximately 4 minutes to execute. Version II calls the GetPrediction procedure twice for each element of idList, and then again in the final display statement. This results in the procedure being called nine times, requiring approximately 9 minutes of execution time.
- Q21 | Answer C. 2^32 times as many values can be represented, because the web site is using 64-bit integers instead of 32-bit integers.
- Q22 | Answer B. Selecting the best move is an optimization problem that cannot be solved in a reasonable time based on the information that the game runs slowly. If the algorithm for selecting the best move is running too slowly, the game may run more quickly if a heuristic is used to find approximate solutions.
- Q39 | Answer D. Using 8 bits will allow for up to 256 characters open parenthesis, 2 raised to the eighth power equals 256, close parenthesis.
- Q48 | Answer D. Certificate authorities are entities that issue digital certificates, which are used to certify the ownership of public keys.
