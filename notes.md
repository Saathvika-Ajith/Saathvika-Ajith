## Tri 3 TPT 2.0 Safe Computing 5.6 -
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- As we create Web Site and post information we are adding to Searchable PII
- Things that will be known by everyone: Name, Email (suggest a junk email), Picture, High School attended, College Attended, Properties you own, State-City of residence, all State-City of previous residence, Credit Report
- Gray area items, more cautious: Birthdate, Place of Birth, Street Address, Phone Number, Maiden names of Mother and Grandmother, Drivers License Number
- Things that you should strive to keep absolutely secret: Credentials for Access, Two-Factor Authentication on Financial accounts, Social Security Number, Tax records
- Safety Concerns:
  - Malware is often sent in attachments to things in email. Often they request you to click on an attachment and it starts the process of adding a virus to your computer.
  - Phishing is where unknown sources try to entice you into a response, like click here and receive $500. Often such systems impersonate someone like Amazon asking for login information.
- Safety Practices: Multi-factor authentication often requires you to enter a code that has been texted or emailed to you. Other types of authentication are biometrics (finger print or facial recognition).
- Types of Encryption:
  - Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information.
  - Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys -- one public key and one private key -- to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use.
  - SSL Uses both Asymmetric and Symmetric Encryption.
- Nefarious Uses of the Internet:
  - Virus or Malware are opposite of Increasing Security.
  - Phishing is a way to get a Virus on your machine, or a way to get you to input PII.
### Pages Action - 
- #1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
  - Our deployed websites may be a source of PII, even if things like our name and school aren't on there, the website domain could be traced back to DNHS, our location, and even the compsci classes in particular. Another is our Github profiles, they're public, and most people have their given and offical name on their githubs.
- #2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
  - As a kid, and as an absolute nobody, it doesn't effect me much. Any information about me that's out there can't really be used against me, plus I've been careful. If I was a famous or well known figure, any and all losely guarded information could and would be pried out of me, and now that, would be a way more dangerous situation. PII and expose plus their effects vary from person to person.
- #3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
  - A very bad yet very common password is 1234. It's short, all numbers in ascending order, and usually the first thing people try when guessing a password to anything because it's so low effort. A good password would be long, have upper and lowercase, and special charecters, because that all adds and multiplies to the number of possible passwords that someone or some machine can guess.
- #4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
  - Symmetric Encyption uses the same method to lock and unlock an object or piece of information, while Asymmetric Encryption uses one method to lock and seal it, and another way to unseal and unlock it. 
- #5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
  - When we deployed a website in our class last trimester, I didn't observe any forms of encryption being used, but if I had to guess, we would've used Symmetric because our school projects don't exactly comtain top secret information, that's in need of protection.
- #6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
  - Once some scam callers called my grandma and tricked her out of a large sum of money, not once, but twice in the same call. They had some sort of sob story that she fell for, and attained her bank account information. She only realized some time later, with help from my mom. Other techniques include spam email, and links in shady websites, both of which can install malware.


## Tri 3 TPT 2.0 Legal and Ethical Concerns 5.5 - 
- Qualcomm makes its money on patents, and if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents. 
- Open Source by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared. 
- Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment, + anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty.
- The Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. The Workers of Today aren't entirely different.
- Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
  - The Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest in a work you've created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain.
- Open Source MIT License
  - This license in friendly to someone like Qualcomm! This allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions.
- Open Source GPL License
  - The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions.
- Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. 
  - Most of us buy subscriptions to services. However, some figure out ways to bypass systems and allow download. 
  - Often we will see these sites disappear, as they are illegal.
- Mostly, if we use things in class, there is no problem with Open Source as it is considered educational use. 
- Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class.
- Creative Commons and Open Source are free terminologies! However, businesses will not last without income. And today, businesses won't last without engineers pulling Open Source software.
### Pages Action -
- #1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
  - Done.
- #2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
  - Our team thinks our project, an official website for the PUSD CTE would use an Open Source MIT License because all the information present on its pages will be specific to PUSD, and no one other than PUSD will have the need to distribute or profit off the things offered in our project.


## Tri 3 TPT 1.1 Crowdsourcing 5.4 -
- The more you crowdsource, the more you reach beyond your own community, the more you will reduce computer bias, since it provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.
- Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing. It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it's often corrected through a self-policing community.
- Crypto currency and associated block chain: all exchanges of money are validated at least 3 times by independent miners, and if there's a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again. 
  - Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impacts on how governments think about currency. Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing projects.
- COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing. This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks. 
- We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API's, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data.
- We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. 
### Pages Action -
- #1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
  - A crowdsourcing idea is to base a project on students answers, and hold a huge survey, tally up everyone's answers, and have accurate data for the project. Another is to have a huge project that has code contributed to it by every student.
- #2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
  - Our final project is an official website for the DNHS CTE department, and ideally this website will increase the number of students taking CTE courses. A crowdsourcing oppurtunity could be to have as many students as possible take a survey about the things they find the most engaging and interesting in a website.


## Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3 -
- talking about the beneficial and harmful effects of computing often lead to conversations on computer bias; particularly when bias creates a harmful effect.
- Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
  - Facebook targets an older demographic while Tiktok targets teens. It doesn't seem particularly harmful though, unless tiktok starts trying to reach younger and younger people.
- Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
  - It probably wasn't purposeful, because more poeple being able to use their products seems like more business, it probably isn't that harmful but should be corrected, since it doesn't seem like good business.
- Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers? Is it harmful? Is it good business?
  - People who like a certain type of show and will be more likely to watch shows that are similar, I don't think it's harmful, it's usually quite helpful, and it definaetly is good business because it keeps people hooked to their subscription.
### Pages Action -
- #1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - the maker of the video is obviously making it as a joke, and knows that this is just a (probably) unintentional flaw in the programming of the face tracking software, in which they didn't account for people having different skin colors other than white. 
- #2. If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
  - This seems like a flaw in the programming of the face tracking software, in which they didn't account for people having different skin colors other than white. It makes me wonder how it even works, if it depends on skin color and not things like recognizing eyes and facial features.
- #3. How do you think this happened?
  - The programmers that worked and tested this software were probably all white (males) and didn't acount for any POC in their creation and processes.
- #4. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - Yes, this is certainly harmful, but it doesn't seem like something that was put in there to personally attack or exclude POC.
- #5. Should it be corrected?
  - It should be corrected as soon as possible.
- #6. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
  - The testing and designing process for any product intended towards a vide variety of people should also be made and tested on a variety of people and consumers to have the best possible end result.


## Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2 -
- Poorer or rural areas in America and other countries may have less or little access to Technology, and some countries may have different or restricted access, for instance China and USA have a divide in the services allowed on their internet.
- Individual may have less access to latest updates, and thus may be working on older generations of computers.
- San Diego county has regional distinction in many categories between Northern and Southern population, usually indicated by the Interstate 8, also Sunnyvale CA has been know as technology hub of influence for the entirety of the United States.
- Del Norte CSP preferences are that you have your own computer so that you can work away from school, plus internet blockers at router and lack of admin password can make school computer less productive than personally owned computer.
- Education officials are often concerned about cyberbullying, sexting, or student privacy, but investments being made in protection (immense) versus investments being made in technology education (bare minimum) are at a large disparity. Are digital fears expanding digital divide?
### Pages Action -
- #1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
  - It is important not to tie your entire identity to who you are or what you do online. Have hobbies, passions, and interests that don't depend on the internet or technology.
- #2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte?
  - At Del Norte, you could let someone borrow your personal computer for a while if you don't need it at the moment, and they have a hw assignment to do online, and all the school computers are occupied. Collaboration is very important.
- #3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
  - Some barriers at Del Norte are that it isn't made sure that every student has unlimited access to technology at home. Digital assignments are just given, and expected to be done within a certain time frame, with late points being docked if the work is delayed for any reason. Though it may not be the most common scenario in this day and age, it is important to still consider all the possibilities.


## Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1 -
- UAVs and Drones are used in search & rescue, aerial photography, and for hobbies. They can be both beneficial and detrimental, based on on the users and use of the tech. Since their invention, many unintended uses were discovered.
- Video games and Social media are shown to impact people chemically. However, statistically some people's computer time may be greater than their sleep time. There are both pros and cons to these forms of entertainment.
- Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers. Their innovation lead to both beneficial and harmful effects in our world.
### Pages Action - 
- #1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:
  - Many Students have access to the Internet; Students may Google the answers to HW
  - People get famous on Social Media and earn money; They good use their money and influence to do or promote harmful things
  - Smart homes are becoming more popular, and are extremely convenient; Entire homes could be hacked and taken over by malevolent people
- #2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
  - I'm sure that the dopamine issues talked about are real, but it's doubtful that anyone else will reach the extreme levels of Anthony Rosner. My personal study and success in Del Norte are not being affected by dopamine or internet addiction. While the whole story does seem a bit edged in parent conspiracy, I feel that it's not unreasonable to expect teens to self-regulate.
