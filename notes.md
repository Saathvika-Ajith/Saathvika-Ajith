# Tri 3 TPT 1.1 Crowdsourcing 5.4 -
- The more you crowdsource, the more you reach beyond your own community, the more you will reduce computer bias, since it provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing.
- Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing. It can have inaccuracies, but when it does it's often corrected through a self-policing community.
- Crypto currency and associated block chain: all exchanges of money are validated at least 3 times by independent miners, and if there's a flaw in the independent calculations the process is checked and performed again. 
  - Innovation of crypto crowdsourcing has impacts on how governments think about currency. Additionally, block chain algorithms are being considered for many other crowdsourcing projects.
- COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing. This data has impacted all our lives and decision we make on attending public events, flying on planes, or wearing masks. 
- We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API's, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data.
- We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history.

- #1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
  - A crowdsourcing idea is to base a project on students answers, and hold a huge survey, tally up everyone's answers, and have accurate data for the project. Another is to have a huge project that has code contributed to it by every student.
- #2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
  - Our final project is an official website for the DNHS CTE department, and ideally this website will increase the number of students taking CTE courses. A crowdsourcing oppurtunity could be to have as many students as possible take a survey about the things they find the most engaging and interesting in a website.


## Tri 3 TPT 1.0 Computing Bias 5.3 -
- talking about the beneficial and harmful effects of computing often lead to conversations on computer bias; particularly when bias creates a harmful effect.
- Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
  - Facebook targets an older demographic while Tiktok targets teens. It doesn't seem particularly harmful though, unless tiktok starts trying to reach younger and younger people.
- Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
  - It probably wasn't purposeful, because more poeple being able to use their products seems like more business, it probably isn't that harmful but should be corrected, since it doesn't seem like good business.
- Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers? Is it harmful? Is it good business?
  - People who like a certain type of show and will be more likely to watch shows that are similar, I don't think it's harmful, it's usually quite helpful, and it definaetly is good business because it keeps people hooked to their subscription.

- #1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - the maker of the video is obviously making it as a joke, and knows that this is just a (probably) unintentional flaw in the programming of the face tracking software, in which they didn't account for people having different skin colors other than white. 
- #2. If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
  - This seems like a flaw in the programming of the face tracking software, in which they didn't account for people having different skin colors other than white. It makes me wonder how it even works, if it depends on skin color and not things like recognizing eyes and facial features.
- #3. How do you think this happened?
  - The programmers that worked and tested this software were probably all white (males) and didn't acount for any POC in their creation and processes.
- #4. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - yes, this is certainly harmful, but it doesn't seem like something that was put in there to personally attack or exclude POC.
- #5. Should it be corrected?
  - It should be corrected as soon as possible.
- #6. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
  - The testing and designing process for any product intended towards a vide variety of people should also be made and tested on a variety of people and consumers to have the best possible end result.


## Tri 3 TPT 0.2 related to Digital Divide Big Idea 5.2 -
- Poorer or rural areas in America and other countries may have less or little access to Technology, and some countries may have different or restricted access, for instance China and USA have a divide in the services allowed on their internet.
- Individual may have less access to latest updates, and thus may be working on older generations of computers.
- San Diego county has regional distinction in many categories between Northern and Southern population, usually indicated by the Interstate 8, also Sunnyvale CA has been know as technology hub of influence for the entirety of the United States.
- Del Norte CSP preferences are that you have your own computer so that you can work away from school, plus internet blockers at router and lack of admin password can make school computer less productive than personally owned computer.
- Education officials are often concerned about cyberbullying, sexting, or student privacy, but investments being made in protection (immense) versus investments being made in technology education (bare minimum) are at a large disparity. Are digital fears expanding digital divide?
### Pages Action
- #1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
  - It is important not to tie your entire identity to who you are or what you do online. Have hobbies, passions, and interests that don't depend on the internet or technology.
- #2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte?
  - At Del Norte, you could let someone borrow your personal computer for a while if you don't need it at the moment, and they have a hw assignment to do online, and all the school computers are occupied. Collaboration is very important.
- #3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
  - Some barriers at Del Norte are that it isn't made sure that every student has unlimited access to technology at home. Digital assignments are just given, and expected to be done within a certain time frame, with late points being docked if the work is delayed for any reason. Though it may not be the most common scenario in this day and age, it is important to still consider all the possibilities.


## Tri 3 TPT 0.1 related to Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing Big Idea 5.1 -
- UAVs and Drones are used in search & rescue, aerial photography, and for hobbies. They can be both beneficial and detrimental, based on on the users and use of the tech. Since their invention, many unintended uses were discovered.
- Video games and Social media are shown to impact people chemically. However, statistically some people's computer time may be greater than their sleep time. There are both pros and cons to these forms of entertainment.
- Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers. Their innovation lead to both beneficial and harmful effects in our world.
### Pages Action
- #1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:
  - Many Students have access to the Internet; Students may Google the answers to HW
  - People get famous on Social Media and earn money; They good use their money and influence to do or promote harmful things
  - Smart homes are becoming more popular, and are extremely convenient; Entire homes could be hacked and taken over by malevolent people
- #2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
  - I'm sure that the dopamine issues talked about are real, but it's doubtful that anyone else will reach the extreme levels of Anthony Rosner. My personal study and success in Del Norte are not being affected by dopamine or internet addiction. While the whole story does seem a bit edged in parent conspiracy, I feel that it's not unreasonable to expect teens to self-regulate.
